# Advancing-Kubernetes-and-HPC

## 2. Users/Personas Of The Project:

Because of Lustre's wide scalability, high-performance, and high-availability, and Kubernetes' portability and extensibility, cloud-native HPC with Lustre has two major kinds of users:

- Researchers who need to perform HPC tasks with parallel file system.
- Data engineers and analysts who need to analyze massive volumes of data.

When users utilize Lustre, they don't need to have knowledge about file system, perform operations to scale up or to scale down the pods, create a new Lustre instance if one is crashed, or manually setup complex Kubernetes configurations.
